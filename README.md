# java-explore-with-me
Template repository for ExploreWithMe project.

The java-explore-with-me application has been developed. It allows users to share information about interesting events
and find a company to participate in them. This application is a poster. In this poster you can propose any event from 
an exhibition to a trip to the cinema and gather a company to participate in it. A microservice architecture has been 
implemented using docker/ The application includes two services: - the main service will contain everything necessary 
for the product to operate; - the statistics service will store the number of views and allow you to make various 
samples to analyze the operation of the application. 
Storage is carried out in the database.
